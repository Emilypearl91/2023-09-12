  <h1>Process</h1>
<p>Crocheted fabric is begun by placing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_knot">slip-knot</a> loop on the hook (though other methods, such as a magic ring or simple folding over of the yarn may be used), pulling another loop through the first loop, and repeating this process to create a chain of a suitable length.</p>
<p>The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined to the beginning of the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single loop. Stitches are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.</p>
<p>At any one time at the end of a stitch, there is only one loop left on the hook. <strong>Tunisian crochet</strong>, however, draws all of the loops for an entire row onto a long hook before working them off one at a time. Like knitting, crochet can be worked either flat (back and forth in rows) or in the round (in spirals, such as when making tubular pieces).[citation needed]</p>
  <h2>Types of stitches</h2>
  <p> There are six main types of basic stitches (the following description uses US crochet terminology which differs from the terminology used in the UK and Europe).</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Chain stitch</strong> – the most basic of all stitches and used to begin most projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Slip stitch</strong> – used to join chain stitch to form a ring.</li>
  <li><strong>Single crochet stitch</strong> (called double crochet stitch in the UK) – easiest stitch to master</li>
  <li><strong>Half-double crochet stitch</strong>(called half treble stitch in the UK) – the 'in-between' stitch, sometimes called short double crochet in vintage publications</li>
  <li><strong>Double crochet stitch</strong> (called treble stitch in the UK) (yarn over once) – many uses for this unlimited use stitch</li>
  <li><strong>Treble (or triple) crochet stitch</strong> (called double treble stitch in the UK) (yarn over twice)</li>
</ul>
  <p>While the horizontal distance covered by these basic stitches is the same, they differ in height and thickness.[citation needed]</p>
  <p> The more advanced stitches are often combinations of these basic stitches, or are made by inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations. More advanced stitches include the shell stitch, V stitch, spike stitch, Afghan stitch, butterfly stitch, popcorn stitch, cluster stitch, and crocodile stitch.</p>
